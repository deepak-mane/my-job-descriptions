# Data Structures and Algorithms for Robotics

to understand both discrete and continuous planning algorithms; A*, D*, anytime algorithms, RRTs, PRMs, state-lattices, path primitive approaches, etc. As for data structures; you should know graphs in detail - what are the trade-offs between adjacency matrices versus lists?, should you store edge weights up front or compute them on the fly?, should you prune out invalid edges or just nullify the weighting? Knowledge of trees, heaps, red-black trees, and hashmaps will certainly help.
