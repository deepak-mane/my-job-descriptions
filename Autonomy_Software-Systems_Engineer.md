# Autonomy Software - Systems Engineer
- [Mountain View, California, United States](https://waymo.com/joinus/1291820/)

### Role :
1. Find patterns in operations and testing issues that span software modules, prioritize them, and work with the development teams to develop cross-team solutions that have high impact by generalizing well
1. Develop software performance specifications, defining the scenarios the car must handle, and what acceptable performance in those scenarios is. Also develop quantified interface specifications between major software modules (e.g. perception & planning)
1. Develop methods to verify (is it doing things we know correctly) and validate (is it doing the correct things) software features using a mixture of simulation, closed-course testing, and public-roads testing. You will plan and execute tests, analyze test data, and understand and resolve defects, leveraging the operations team where possible. You will also work with the simulation team to continually expand what can be tested rigorously in simulation
1. Use the specifications and tests you’ve developed, your cross-team insights, and close collaboration with software engineers to accelerate the development of robust new features

### Minimum Eligibility Criteria :
1. BA/BS degree in a technical field: computer science, physics, robotics, or equivalent work experience
1. 8+ years relevant work experience

### Preferred if you have:
1. Have, or quickly develop, a strong understanding of complex robotics perception, scene understanding, prediction, and planning algorithms and the real-world issues inherent in these domains
1. The careful mindset required for safety-critical development, the ability to work quickly, and the judgement to balance those qualities
1. Strong test definition and execution skills for complex systems. Be able to define both wise overall approaches and the details of individual tests. Have the software engineering skills to write software required to execute tests. Communicate clearly with operations teams implementing or executing tests. Be driven to find and resolve issues
1. Strong data analysis skills (e.g. using Python or MATLAB), including using large datasets. Ability to write C++ code when needed
1. Robotics software implementation expertise (but a desire to “zoom out” and work with cross-module performance specs, architecture, and tests)
1. Formal systems engineering experience. Capture the benefits of systems engineering with the rigor appropriate for safety-critical systems, without the overhead present in some organizations
