```
It took me about 10+ interview failures to get a job at an elite tech company (f*ck ,yeah!). 
I felt really inferior when I came across so many acceptance-mail (The Big techs')posts on LinkedIn. 
I really hated 'em all cuz I felt they were boasting for nothing(although they shared how happy they were) .

# The Failures
I failed Google,Zoho,Amazon,Goldman Sachs, Postman, DE shaw & co,Bloomberg, RedHat,Paypal interviews. 
Some were really close misses tho. Sooner did I realize that I was growing monstrously 
everytime I lost an interview. I decided not to give up, no matter whatever it takes. 
In the worst-case, I'll end up with strong DS and Algo knowledge that will help me find 
a job at a startup.

# How I got up?
I had infinite resource for confidence. If you don't have that, start working on that. 
I analysed what could've been done better. Finally, I coded as hell.
*Realize that if you don't learn from mistakes, you'd never taste success.*

# My Advise
-> Identify what you love to do. If it's SWE, continue reading, else,you already have the solution.
-> Start doing what interests you the most.
-> Get Data structures strong.
-> Watch Clement Mihailescu , Gaurav Sen , Rachit Jain , YK Sugi youtube and learn 
how they approach to problems.
```

## These 40 companies are the best in the U.S. at attracting and keeping top talent, according to LinkedIn data. Read on for how they do it.
