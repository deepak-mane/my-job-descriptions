# Digital Signal Processing Algorithms

TYPICAL DSP ALGORITHMS
Some DSP algorithms and their typical applications are listed in Table 1.1 [1]. This section reviews several important DSP computations, including correlation, convolution, and digital filters; the stochastic-gradient and least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filters; block matching algorithm for motion estimation (ME), discrete cosine transform (DCT) and vector quantization (VQ) for image processing and compression; Viterbi algorithm and dynamic programming; decimator and interpolator, and wavelets and filter banks for multirate signal processing.
