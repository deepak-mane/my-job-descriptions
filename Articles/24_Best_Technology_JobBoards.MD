# The 24 Best Technology Job Boards to Know:

1. <b>Dice.com</b>
   - While working as a tech Recruiter, Dice was one of the first places I looked to find candidates. It’s an extremely popular technology & IT job board, and is where I’d recommend beginning.

2. <b>Hired.com</b>
   - Hired is another great job board known for focusing on technology positions.
It features high quality, high-salary jobs for a variety of tech fields/disciplines. 

3. <b>Angel.co</b>
   - Angel.co is a massive site… sort of like LinkedIn for entrepreneurs and tech founders/tech workers.
And now they offer job listings too.
So while it’s not only a tech job board in terms of what you can find on the site, it’s one of the best places to quickly find job leads in the companies you want. Highly recommended.

4. <b>The Ladders</b>
   - The Ladders isn’t only a tech job board but it’s the second place I looked as a tech recruiter, when it came to the job boards I scanned through once per week.
Why? It tends to attract higher level people (the job board started out as “$100K+ jobs for $100K+ people”).
They backed down from that slogan and exclusivity but it still attracts high-level job seekers, and therefore high-level employers like many of the tech companies you probably want to work for.

5. <b>CrunchBoard</b>
   - If you follow tech at all you might know about the popular blog TechCrunch.
Well, CrunchBoard is their technology job board and it lists some great tech and IT job postings.
Like most job boards, you can search by location and keyword to narrow down your results and only see relevant job opportunities.

6. <b>StackOverflow Jobs</b>
   - Stack Overflow is the largest online community for software developers to share knowledge and learn new skills. And yes – they now have a job board as well.
This is worth checking out if you’re a software engineer or programmer

7. <b>GitHub Jobs</b>
   - GitHub is a site every software developer should know, but not everyone thinks to go there for jobs. GitHub does have a good, searchable tech job board that’s worth a look for any tech job seekers involved in programming or related fields (like data engineering, etc.)

8. <b>Mashable Jobs</b>
   - Mashable, the popular site for tech news, also has a job board. You can post your resume and search job listings by keywords and city. You can also set up job alerts to be notified when a new posting fits your criteria.

9. <b>Uncubed</b>
   - Uncubed is a job search website featuring jobs from startups as well as Fortune 500 employers.
Positions include software engineering, data engineering, data science, product management, UI/UX, and even sales and marketing positions. 
This is worth a look for any tech job seeker but is especially useful if you have a skill set that falls outside of programming/engineering (for example digital marketing, software sales, etc.)

10. <b>Authentic Jobs</b>
    - Authentic Jobs features job postings for engineers, but also a variety of other positions in tech. 
You can find everything from marketing and copywriting positions to customer support positions here.
So practically anyone can find a suitable tech job on this job board.
If you’re an engineer, this is still worth a look. Don’t read this description and write this off just because it includes other roles in tech. This is also a solid choice for engineering positions.

11. <b>TechCareers</b>
    - While this isn’t the flashiest or most modern-looking technology job board out there, there are some very good job listings on here… and clicking a listing often takes you directly to the employer’s website so you can apply directly and save time.
This is a feature we love, because you’re not wasting time applying without knowing if the job is even still open, etc. (It’s a lot more likely that a job is still open and “active” if it’s still posted on the company’s website).

12. <b>WhiteTruffle</b>
    - White truffle allows you to apply to 7,500+ tech jobs via one application. You will need to create a “candidate account,” to get started, so this isn’t a job board that you can browse without registering.
However, if you’re willing to register and put in the time, it does feature many high-quality employers.

13. <b>IT Job Pro</b>
    - IT Job Pro claims to be the “most popular tech job site,” which simply isn’t true based on our research. However, they do seem to be worth checking out.  
They have multiple postings within the last 24 hours, and they feature some very high level jobs like Vice President of Software Engineering.
They have jobs in software architecture, programming, and much more.
However, the employers featured on this site primarily seem to be large banks, and other huge corporations like Sprint, IBM, etc.
So if you’re looking for small, niche start-ups for your next tech job, this job board might not be the best choice.

14. <b>F6s.com</b>
    - This is a great job board for tech workers who want to join a true start-up. No big banks and corporations here!
They’ve got plenty of jobs in areas like front-end development, full stack development, UI/UX, and even listings of employers looking for technical co-founders, etc. 
And they show compensation for a lot of the jobs, including equity percentage, etc.

15. <b>YCombinator Jobs</b>
    - A simple, but very good technology and start-up job board by Y Combinator. 
The layout looks a bit like craigslist: Ultra-simple and plain.  But the job postings are good, and clicking a listing takes you right to the employer’s website usually, which we love. 

16. <b>Hacker Noon Jobs</b>
    - The popular tech-themed content site Hacker Noon now has a job board that’s worth checking out. 
You can search easily by category, keyword and/or location to find tech jobs, primarily engineering. 

17. <b>Smashing Magazine Job Board</b>
    - This is another content site that got into the job board business and did a pretty good job of it.
Their technology-focused job board has a nice modern interface and is easy to search and use to find tech jobs. 
They feature technology jobs in the US, EU, and other locations. 

18. <b>Venture Loop</b>
    - Another true start-up job board, Venture Loop features 61,000+ start-up jobs at the time of writing this.
They feature a variety of start-up tech jobs, many for VC-funded companies. 

19. <b>Underdog</b>
    - This job site lets you apply to multiple top technology jobs in 60 seconds.
They feature top tech firms like Foursquare, Jet, Airtable, SeatGeek and more. 

20. <b>Jobs Match Skills</b>
    - We weren’t sure what to think of this tech job board at first glance. They’re not popular and they don’t get a lot of traffic.
But the listings look good, and clicking a job posting takes you directly to the employer’s website, which we love (as mentioned earlier).
They have a unique interface that shows which key skills each job features, and they seem to have a steady flow of jobs. We saw 100+ jobs posted just today, which seemed almost too good to be true, but could be possible.
This seems 100% focused on US technology jobs, so this isn’t the best site to find EU technology jobs. Keep reading for a separate section for EU residents. 

21. <b>Tech Fetch</b>
    - Tech Fetch is a great site featuring 100,000+ tech jobs across the US.
They also offer instant job alerts if you want to upload your resume and be notified when new jobs are posted that match your skills.
They offer a “quick apply” feature to upload your resume and submit it to a company with just a few clicks, but you will need to register an account to do apply to any jobs.

22. <b>Work In Startups</b>
    - This site is for EU job seekers. You’ll find a good mix of technology jobs for EU start-ups here.
Note this includes the UK, too. We saw a large number of tech jobs in London, for example. 

23. <b>Honeypot</b>
    - Honeypot is another EU-focused technology job board. They work a bit differently, though. 
Here’s how they describe their site: “Create a profile and let companies apply to you.”
So if you’re a tech job seeker in Europe and that sounds interesting, we’d recommend this.
If you’re not in the EU, and/or you don’t love the idea of uploading info and waiting for technology companies to show interest in you, then this isn’t the best choice.

24. <b>Relocate.me</b>
    - Want to relocate? This is the job site for you. This job board is exclusively focused on jobs with relocation packages.

The job listings seem to be primarily EU-focused, but it does include US tech jobs, too.
