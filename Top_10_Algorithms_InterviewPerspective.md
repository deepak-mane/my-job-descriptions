Understanding the Fundamental Techniques or Algorithms that are common
to most questions then you can tackle any question

[Practice Algorithms](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/)

 1. ] <b>Depth First Search -</b> Graph/Tree Reversal
     - E.g Viewsherarkis, Constructing Binary Search to look through string
 2. ] <b>Breadth First Search -</b>
     - Difference between Depth & Breadth First Search
 3. ] <b>Matching Parenthesis Problem -</b>
     - Brackets correctly closed OR What is the next valid parenthesis
 4. ] <b>Making Use of Hash Tables -</b>
     - Dynamic Programming, Memorization, Caching 
 5. ] <b>How to Manipulate Variable Pointers at the same time</b>
     - You need to know how you can traverse link list with two pointers and how to manipulate multiple pointers. 
     - E.g Problem that asks you to find palindrome longest substring in the full string.
 6. ] <b>Reversing LinkList -</b>
 7. ] <b>Sorting Fundamentals -</b>
     - Quick Sort,Merge Sort,Know Runtime of Sorting, Difference between Sort time Big nlogn.
 8. ] <b>Recursion -</b>
     - Couple of problems in interview are very likely.
     - What you do at every single iteration. What you do at ending of the Recursion
 9. ] <b>Knowing How to Construct Data Structures</b>
     - Something like Suffix Tree like datastructures
     - The idea is to contruct class that will help you create data structure.
10. ] <b>Binary Search</b>
     - Implement Binay Search THOROUGHLY, how does it work.
     - Hidden question that may ask you to use Binary Search but necessary you might have to Implement Binay Search
     - LogN - Timecomplexity of Binary Search
     
     
Not every question is dependend on Algorithm
