# Quick Overview of EB1-C Multinational Executives or Managers
Introduction of EB1-C
North America Immigration Law Group highly specializes in EB1-based immigration petition. The third group in priority workers is for multinational executives or mangers who have been employed abroad in the same corporation. This group makes use the most visas from the annual allotment. In order to qualify as a multinational executive or manager under this preference, the applicant, during the three years preceding the application, must have been employed for at least one year by the same multinational firm or other business entity (affiliate, parent, subsidiary, or branch of the U.S. employer) that employs them in the United States. Furthermore, the applicant must seek to continue rendering services to the same employer in a managerial or executive capacity.

 Labor Certification not Required
As a subcategory of priority workers, labor certification is not required for international managers and executives.

 Self-petition not Allowed
Under the USCIS rules, the U.S. employer must file the petition for the manager or executive transferee. The petition must be accompanied by a statement from the U.S. employer affirming all of the pertinent requirements, including a description of the job duties to be performed by the foreign executive/manager in the United States, the job duties performed by the foreign executive/manager abroad, and the periods of employment by the foreign executive/manager abroad.

 Evidence Required
A petition for a multinational executive or manager must be accompanied by a statement from an authorized official of the petitioning United States employer that lists the period of time the foreign executive/manager worked for the overseas company, the relationship between the overseas and the U.S. companies and the time the U.S. company does business in the U.S.

 Requirements of the U.S. Petitioning Company
USCIS rules require that the prospective employer in the United States be the same employer or a subsidiary or affiliate of the firm or corporation or other legal entity by which the foreign executive/manager was employed abroad.

There is no specific requirement as to the size of the petitioning company or its gross business volume. But USCIS regulations require that the employer be conducting business in two or more countries, one of which is the United States, either directly or through affiliates or subsidiaries. In addition, the company must have been in business in the United States for at least one year prior to the fling of the immigrant visa petition.

 Definitions of “Affiliate“ and “Subsidiary“ in the Rules of a EB1-C Petition?

 What if an Overseas Company was Acquired a U.S. Company?
There is no requirement that a qualifying relationship exist between the U.S. and foreign entity for a period of one year prior to the filing of the EB1-C petition. The regulations only require that the U.S. entity must have been doing business for at least one year. As a result, a U.S. entity that has been acquired by a foreign corporation may immediately file a first preference petition on behalf of a manager or executive who worked for the foreign entity in a qualifying capacity for the requisite period of time.

 Qualifications of a “Manager“
In order to be qualified as a manager, the applicant must satisfy several requirements. Usually, first-line supervisors are excluded from the statutory definition of a manager unless the employees supervised are professionals. Staffing levels are to be considered in relation to the reasonable needs of the business and its stage of development.

The law defines a manager as someone who:

Manages a corporation, department, subdivision, or function.
Supervises and controls the work of other supervisory, professional, or managerial employees, or else manage essential functions.
Has the authority to make personal decisions as to hiring and termination, or else function at a senior level, or
Exercises discretion over the day to day operations of the activity or function for which he or she has authority.
 Qualifications of an “Executive“
An applicant is qualified as an executive if he/she satisfies the following requirements:

The person must manage an organization, major component, or function
The person has the authority to establish goals and policies
The person has wide latitude and discretionary decision making authority or
The person receives only general supervision from higher executives, board of directors, or stockholders
The definition also includes executives who perform tasks necessary to produce the product or provide the service offered by the organization if the executive is also a professional, such as an engineer or architect.

 One out of Three Year Working Requirement
With regard to the length of employment abroad, the USCIS permits the foreign person to have worked for one year out of the preceding three years for the employer abroad, and the regulations do not foreclose the possibility of aggregating employment time during the preceding three-year period in order to attain the one-year requirement.


Alternative to EB-5 (Foreign Investors)
EB1-C would permit an owner of a business enterprise to immigrate to the United States so long as he/she would otherwise satisfy the substantive eligibility requirements. In a situation in which the prospective employee was also an owner of the business that would hire him/her, the USCIS will scrutinize the petition very closely. This category represents an important alternative to EB-5 visa. Proper planning by a qualified investor can result in issuance of a permanent residency visa without the necessity of investing substantial money in a new enterprise.

# EB1-A (Alien of Extraordinary Ability)
Introduction
EB1-A or EB1-EA is a subgroup of first preference employment-based immigration (EB-1). North America Immigration Law Group specializes in EB1-A (Alien of Extraordinary Ability) petitions. This immigration preference category is for foreign nationals of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. According to federal immigration law, such persons are not required to have a prospective employer (unlike EB1-B and EB1-C, and other preference categories), but they must be entering to continue to work in their chosen field, and they must substantially benefit prospectively in the U.S. In addition, the petitioner has to show that the foreign person sustained national or international acclaim with recognized achievements. This is the requirement that is most difficult to prove. Based on our experience, North America Immigration Law Group has developed winning strategy of argument to meet this prong of requirement. To win an extraordinary ability case requires extensive documentation and excellent petition skills of the attorney. You can trust North America Immigration Law Group with your EB1-A case.

 Advantages: No Labor Certification is Required, Self Petition is Allowed
There are many advantages of the employment-based category EB1-A. First of all, a specific job offer is not required for a foreign person in this group, as long as the foreign person is entering the United States to continue work in the field in which he or she has extraordinary ability, therefore self-petition is allowed. Please note, the fact that self-petition is allowed does not mean you should choose a DIY petition. Petition for an immigration visa is a complicated process and you may want an immigration attorney to handle all the complicated legal and regulation issues. North America Immigration Law Group has filed countless successful EB1-A petitions for our clients.

Moreover, a labor certification not required. Obtaining a labor certification is a long process. EB1-A applications therefore save an applicant a lot of time. As a result, attorneys in North America Immigration Law Group encourage clients to petition for this classification if they are qualified.

Visas for EB1-A are current. This is the benefit for all first preference employment-based categories. Immigrant visas remain immediately available for all countries in the first employment-based (EB-1) preference category. Principal attorney of North America Immigration Law Group indicated that it is unlikely that there will be any cut-off dates in the EB-1 preference during the coming months.

 Qualifications of an EB1-A Petitioner
In order to be qualified for an EB1-A visa, the petitioner must show: the foreign person has sustained national or international acclaims for his/her achievements, the foreign person is seeking to enter the United States to continue to work in the field of endeavor that is the subject of the acclaim, and the presence of the foreign person and his/her activity will benefit the United States. If you have questions about these three requirements, you may contact North America Immigration Law Group. Click here to read (Qualification of EB1A (Alien of Extraordinary Ability) ).

Definitions and Evidence of “Extraordinary Ability“
Federal regulations define “extraordinary ability“ as a level of expertise indicating the individual is one of a small percentage who have risen to the very top of a particular field in the sciences, arts, education, business, and athletics. The federal law indicates that such a person will have received national and international acclaim. National or international acclaims can be demonstrated by receipt of a major internationally recognized award such as Nobel Prize or the Academy Award. Alternatively, immigration law requires that the petitioner must provide at least three of the following types of evidence:

Receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.
Membership in an association that requires outstanding achievement as a condition of membership in the field for which the classification is sought
Published material about the foreign person or his or her work in professional, trade journals, or major media publications. (These items must include title, date, author, and must be translated into English)
The foreign person's participation, on a panel or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or a related field
Evidence of original contributions, usually through publication, of major significance in the foreign national's fields of science, scholastic, artistic, or athletic
Authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional journals, or other major media (national newspapers, magazines, etc.)
Display of the foreign national's work at significant exhibitions
Performance in a significant role for organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation
Receipt of a higher salary or remuneration than is usual in the field
Commercial success in the performing arts as shown by box office receipts or sales records, cassette, compact disk, or video sales, or
Other comparable evidence if the above types of evidence do not readily apply to the foreign national's occupations
The meanings of these evidentiary criteria are ambiguous. Cases in front of AAO (Administrative Appeal Office) have indicated that not every criterion applies to every foreign beneficiary. Even immigration attorneys sometimes confuse which evidentiary criterion applies to their clients. North America Immigration Law Group can accurately distinguish which criterion applies to a client's application based on years of strict legal training and experience of our attorneys.

 “Very top of the Endeavor“
With regard to the requirement that the foreign person represents a “small percentage who has risen to the very top“ of the field of endeavor, AAO cases indicate that the actual field of endeavor must be defined before determining whether the foreign person has extraordinary ability in that field. North America Immigration Law Group is of the opinion that if the field is narrowly defined, it is more likely to argue that the foreign person has risen to the top of the field. In Victoria Chen's Blog article Have You Risen to the very Top of the Endeavor?  Ms. Chen explained that petitioners should take advantage of the foreign beneficiary's past education and working experience to define the field of endeavor. However, it is not true that the more narrow the field is defined, the more likely that the petition will be approved. Some AAO cases have pointed that the adjudicating officers get suspicious about cases in which the field is so narrowly defined that rising to the top of the endeavor is meaningless.

 How to Present Evidence
Attorneys of North America Immigration Law Group, are of the opinion that the best way to address the question whether the foreign person is “one of the small percentage who have risen to the very top“ of his or her field is to present evidence that provides a basis for comparison between the foreign person and those persons who are average or typical in the field. For example, if the foreign national is in a field in which publication of scholarly articles is typical, North America Immigration Law Group will present evidence that the client's articles have appeared in the most prestigious journals in the field, have been the subject of peer review in such journals, or have been widely cited in other scholarly articles.

 Comparing to Approved Cases
Although USCIS tried to downplay comparison to other approved cases in the same field of endeavor, attorneys of North America Immigration Law Group have found that the court and AAO consistently stated that the agency rules themselves make comparison with others in the field the controlling standard for awarding extraordinary ability status. Therefore, how USCIS has treated other persons in the field with comparable qualifications is highly relevant to an extraordinary ability case.

 Two-Part Approach Taken by the USCIS Adjudicators
In 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the denial of a petition filed under the classification of EB1-A, the Kazarian case. The AAO determines that Kazarian case sets forth a two-part approach : Part One: Counting the Types of Evidence Provided; Part Two: Final Merits Determination.
