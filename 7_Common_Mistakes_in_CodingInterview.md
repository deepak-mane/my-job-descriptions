# 7 Common Mistakes in Coding Interview
1. Get 1 Referrals to intternship etc
2. Make sure your applying. Don't get discouraged. TechLead failed Thrice before getting selected at Google. 
   + First get offer and then think about joining or not
3. Focusing too much on Tech. Its really not about that. Show friendly side. 
   + Friendly Professional Nature
	 + 2-Techincal things
	 + 2-Personal things(stories) Leadership, Teamwork
4. Independent Project [ Client & Backend and API communication, ]
5. Working Fast. 
   + Pack more in time. 
   + Productivity , 
   + Effeciency
6. People Want to See you Code. Don't  wave just hands
	 + Resume needs to be clear of Project which helps interviewer for giving feedback
7. First thing is Analysis. 
   + Time Space Analysis. 
   + Design Doc, then code
   
<b>IMPORTANT TIP</b> People Don't prepare Fundamentally. DO THAT

Probablity Statistics --------------- NEEDED


## QUESTION ::::::::::::::::::::
- What do you define as a good project for a computer science student? Making an app, doing an Arduino project, combining both...etc.

ANSWER:::::::::::::::::::::::
So simple, I'm glad you asked.  
Make a client / server -- this mimics how most companies operate so your project will fit right in.  The server 
exposes some API -- ideally, code it in Python, or maybe PHP or something.  The client should be done in say 
Android, iOS, or mobile web (ie., choose some web framework).  Then be able to explain the design choices, 
tradeoffs, and how the client communicates to the server.  That's all I want to hear!This will cover how "most"
feature teams are operating today.  Ultimately people are categorized into say iOS, Android, frontend, or 
backend so choose one to concentrate in a bit more.
Of course, there are other areas -- ie., if you're into ML, AR/VR, or robotics, then it's a bit more 
specialized and then you'd pick a project to show off something in that area.
