## 1. Software Engineer, Autonomous Mapping
Level 5 is looking for doers and creative problem solvers to join us in developing the leading self-driving system for ridesharing. Our team members come from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise, and each has the opportunity to have an outsized influence on the future of our technology. Our world-class software and hardware experts work in brand new garages and labs in Palo Alto, California, and offices in London, England and Munich, Germany. And we’re moving at an incredible pace: we’re currently servicing employee rides in our test vehicles on the Lyft app. Learn more at lyft.com/level5.

As part of the AV Maps Team, you will be interacting on a daily basis with other software engineers to tackle advanced AI challenges. Eventually we expect all Autonomy Team members to work on a variety of problems across the autonomy space, however, with a generalist focus, your work will initially involve contributing across the different problems and sub teams to ensure extremely high-quality, high-performance code is used in all of our mission critical AI systems. For this position, we are looking for a software engineer with a strong interest in developing the next generation of autonomous vehicles and a deep knowledge of C++ and computational thinking, but without a specific background in AI or Machine Learning.

### Responsibilities
 1. Work with artificial intelligence and machine learning engineers to develop core algorithms that will power Lyft's self-driving cars
 2. Raise the bar across Level 5 on code quality, design, and architecture
 3. Implement high-performance, mission-critical code that will run on the car and in the cloud
 4. Lead designs of major software components, systems, and features across multiple teams
 5. Design, develop, test, deploy, maintain and improve software.
 6. Manage individual projects priorities, deadlines and deliverables with your technical expertise.
 7. Mentor and train other team members on design techniques, and coding standards
 8. Work with AV sensor data to build HD maps for self-driving vehicles
 9. Design and develop efficient, scalable algorithms and pipelines to quickly process large-scale sensor data from an autonomous fleet

### Requirements
 1. BS degree in Computer Science or related field, MS or PhD is a plus
 2. 1+ years working experience in Linux C++ software development
 3. Good organization and communication skills and team player
 4. Experience with Java, Python, Protobuf language programming is a plus
 5. Experience with point cloud data or other self-driving car sensor data is a plus
 6. GIS or map development experience is a plus

### Responsibilities:
 1. Design, implement and optimize routing algorithms
 2. Experience in large-scale maps and routing is a strong plus
 3. Hands on experience in 3D computer vision, point clouds, etc.
 4. Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks; applying ML and CNN/DNN techniques to handle different tasks related to mapping.
 5. Familiarity with maps, loop closure, map datums, and projections.
 6. C, C++, Python experience

### Experience & Skills
 1. Ability to produce production-quality C++
 2. Advanced working knowledge of C++11 and STL
 3. Ability to deal with complex algorithms and data structures
 4. Ability to write testable, modular code for safety-critical systems
 5. Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field
 6. Ability to work in a fast-paced environment and collaborate across teams and disciplines
 7. Openness to new/different ideas. Ability to evaluate multiple approaches and choose the best one based on first principle

### Nice To Have
 1. 5+ years developing production quality C++
 2. Experience with multi-threading and concurrency in complex software
 3. Experience with GPU programming in CUDA or OpenCL
 4. Deep knowledge of Linux operating system
 5. Advanced understanding of debugging, profiling, and monitoring complex C++ software
